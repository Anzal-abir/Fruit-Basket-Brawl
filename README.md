🍇🍒 Fruit Match Battle + Tic-Tac-Toe Cheat Mode 🎮

Fruit Match Battle is a dynamic two-player game that combines fast-paced fruit matching with a secret Tic-Tac-Toe (TTT) cheat mode to gain an edge over your opponent!

🕹️ Features
Dynamic Grid Platform: Players move across a grid where hidden fruits are placed randomly.

Two-Player Mode: One player is represented by a rectangle and the other by a circle, making identification easy.

Four Different Fruits: Match identical fruits to turn the blocks green. Once matched, fruits disappear and are sent to each player’s individual basket.

First- and Third-Person Camera Views: Switch between immersive first-person mode and tactical third-person mode anytime during gameplay.

Hint System: Before the round starts, fruits are revealed for 1 second, giving players a short memory challenge.

Movement and Collision: Players move freely using WASD keys. Realistic collision detection ensures you can only interact with nearby blocks.

Timer: Each game is limited to 120 seconds. Collect as many matches as possible before time runs out!

🎯 Gameplay
Players explore the grid and uncover blocks to find matching fruits. The faster and more accurately you match, the better your chances of winning. Every matched pair disappears from the grid and fills your basket. Movement is free-form but strategic, requiring careful planning and fast reflexes.

A fun twist is introduced with the Tic-Tac-Toe (Cheat Mode) located at the side of the platform. By winning a round of TTT, a player can:

Press T to toggle back to the Fruit Game.

Press K to add an extra point to their score!

Switching between the main game and the cheat mode adds an extra layer of strategy to outsmart your opponent.
